## About The Project

**Job Card Planner** is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed for teams that need to plan, track, and manage job cards efficiently. It offers a seamless way to add and visualize job cards through a calendar view, and plan them using a simple drag-and-drop mechanism.

### Key Features
- **Job Card Calendar View**: Plan your job cards by simply dragging and dropping them on the calendar. 
- **Status Updates**: Job cards change color based on their status, providing a visual cue for tracking progress.
- **Additional Fields**: Add details like the planned start date, end date, and the assigned employee directly on the job cards.
